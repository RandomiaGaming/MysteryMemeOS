Huge shout out to the wonderful people who created the assets and media from which this silly little program get's its personality.
Note that MysteryMemeware and it's creator Jacobi Christ are not associated with any of the people refrenced in this document.
I just used their songs and artwork in my app and wanted to give credit to the artists.

MysterySong:
The real name of MysterySong is Happy Happy Christmas by Thomas Mogensen.
He released this track back in 1998 under the username Drax.
It was created using FastTracker 2 and the original xm file can be found on modarchive.org:

Thomas Mogensen also has a soundcloud profile although he never uploaded Happy Happy Christmas on there:

MysteryImage:
The MysteryImage was originally a pixel art meme uploaded to the form somethingawful.com.
I couldn't find the original person who made the graphic since the post is long gone but if you know the artist please reach out.
In 2011 PIFTS.exe uploaded a video to their YouTube channel which seems to be the first time that someone combined Happy Happy Christmas with the "It is a mystery" meme:

The HD remake of the "It is a mystery" meme was done by cheesycoke. The HD remake video is now unlisted but can still be seen here:

The font used in both MysteryImage and the original by cheesycoke is called Poor Richard.
It was created by Microsoft and several other companies. Info about it can be found here:
